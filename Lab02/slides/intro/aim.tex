\subsection[Aim]{Aim of the experiment}
\begin{frame}{Aim}{Purpose of this lab assignment}
	\begin{itemize}
	\item Observe the motion of an object that is \textbf{dropped from rest
    and falls somewhat slowly}, straight down.
	\item Analyzing the motion using software tools (Tracker) and capturing
    the object's positions at uniform time intervals.
	\item Constructing two computational models as below:
        \begin{enumerate}
        \item One that only includes the effect of gravity
        \item Both the effect of gravity and of drag (air resistance)
        \end{enumerate}
	\end{itemize}
