\subsection{Newton's Second Law}
\begin{frame}{Newton's Second Law}{Quantitative analysis of motion}
	``The net force acting on a body is defined as the change in its 
	momentum per unit time.''
	\begin{equation}
	\vec{F}_{net} = \frac{\mathrm{d}\vec{p}}{\mathrm{d}t}
	\end{equation}
	In most daily life scenarios, mass doesn't change with respect to
	time, hence this equation is better known as:
	\[\vec{F}_{net} = m\cdot\vec{a}\]
	where,
	\begin{itemize}
	\item \(\vec{F}_{net} = \) Net force acting on a body
	\item \(m = \) Mass of the body
	\item \(\vec{a} = \frac{\mathrm{d}\vec{v}}{\mathrm{d}t} 
		= \frac{\mathrm{d}^2\vec{r}}{\mathrm{d}t^2} = \) 
		Net acceleration on body	
	\item \(\Delta\vec{p} = m\times\Delta\vec{v} = \)
		Change in momentum
	\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Corollary: The Momentum Principle}{Rearranging the equation}
	\begin{equation}
	\Delta \vec{p} = \vec{F}_{net} \times {\Delta t}
	\end{equation}
	where,
	\begin{itemize}
	\item \(\vec{F}_{net} = \) Net force acting on a body	
	\item \(\Delta\vec{p} = \)
		Change in momentum
	\end{itemize}
