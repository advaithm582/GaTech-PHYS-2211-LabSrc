\subsection{Hooke's Law}
\begin{frame}{Hooke's Law}{Measuring spring forces}
	``The magnitude of the force exerted by a stretched spring is directly proportional to its change in length.''
	\begin{equation}
	\vec{F}_{s} = - k \left(L - L_0\right) \hat{L}
	\end{equation}
	where,
	\begin{itemize}
	\item \(\vec{F}_s = \) The vector force exerted by the spring.
    \item \(L = \) The current length of the spring (scalar).
    \item \(\hat{L} = \) The unit vector pointing from the fixed end of the spring to the free end.
    \item \(L_0 = \) The natural length of the spring.
	\end{itemize}
