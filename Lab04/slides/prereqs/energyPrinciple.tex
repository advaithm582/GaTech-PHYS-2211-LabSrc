\subsection{Energy Principle}
\begin{frame}{Energy Principle}
	``The change in energy of a system is equivalent to the external work done on it.''
	\begin{equation}
	\Delta E = W_{ext}
	\end{equation}
	where,
	\begin{itemize}
	\item \(\Delta E = \) Change in energy of the system.
    \item \(W_{ext} = \) The external work done by the surroundings.
	\end{itemize}
\end{frame}
