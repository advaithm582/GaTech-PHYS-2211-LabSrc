\subsection{Newton's Second Law}
\begin{frame}{Newton's Second Law}{Quantitative analysis of motion}
	``The net force acting on a body is defined as the change in its 
	momentum per unit time.''
	\begin{equation}
	\vec{F}_{net} = \frac{\mathrm{d}\vec{p}}{\mathrm{d}t}
	\end{equation}
	where,
	\begin{itemize}
	\item \(\vec{F}_{net} = \) Net force acting on a body
	\item \(m = \) Mass of the body
	\item \(\Delta\vec{p} = m\times\Delta\vec{v} = \)
		Change in momentum
	\end{itemize}
	For this experiment, we turn this into the \textbf{update} form:
	\[ \vec{p_f} = \vec{p_i} + \vec{F}_{net} \times \Delta t \]
	Dividing by \(m\) on both sides:
	\begin{equation}\label{VelocityUpdate}
	\vec{v_f} = \vec{v_i} + \frac{\vec{F}_{net}}{m} \cdot \Delta t
	\end{equation}
\end{frame}
