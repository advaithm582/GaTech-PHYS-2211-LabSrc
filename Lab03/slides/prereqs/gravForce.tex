\subsection{Newton's Universal law of Gravitation}
\begin{frame}{Newton's Universal law of Gravitation}
	``The gravitational force acting of an object is directly proportional
    to the mass of the two objects, and inversely proportional to the square
    of the distance between the planets.''
	\begin{equation}
	\vec{F}_{g,21} = \frac{Gm_1m_2}{|\vec{r}_{21}|^2}\cdot \hat{r}_{12}
	\end{equation}
	where,
	\begin{itemize}
	\item \(\vec{F}_{g,21} = \) The gravitational force on object 1 due to 
    object 2.
    \item \(m_1 = \) Mass of the first body
    \item \(m_2 = \) Mass of the second body
	\item \(\vec{r}_{21} = \vec{r}_2 - \vec{r}_1 = \) The vector ``distance'' between the planets
		Change in momentum
	\end{itemize}
